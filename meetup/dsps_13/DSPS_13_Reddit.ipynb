            "\n",
            "\n",
            "1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.\n",
            "2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.\n",
            "4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.\n",
            "5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‘right’ moment isn’t going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it’s in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.\n",
            "6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. \n",
            "7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That’s how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It’s that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up —> the more people jump on —> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says “fuck it” and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.\n",
            "8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples’ lives, their children’s lives, and their grandchildren’s lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.\n",
            "9. This is not going to come without it’s trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don’t get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.\n",

            "1157 ET - President Biden's nominee to lead the SEC is worried that the business of executing small investors' stock orders has gotten too concentrated. Gary Gensler signals concern about the heft of one firm in particular--Citadel Securities--though he stops short of naming it outright. \"Frankly, just a... handful of financial firms are buying most of the retail flow in America,\" he says in response to a question from Sen. Mark Warner. After noting how Facebook dominates the social-media space, Gensler noted that \"one firm\" handles between 40% and 50% of order flow from retail brokerages, in an apparent allusion to Citadel Securities. \"So what does that do to pricing of capital in this country? I think there's important economic questions,\" Gensler says. Citadel Securities' role in executing small investors' orders has come under scrutiny in the wake of wild volatility in the price of GameStop stock earlier this year.
